I used felt so that the letters wouldn't have raw edges and so the whole thing would be durable and low-maintenance (not prone to wrinkling!). And now, years after I graduated and even though no one in the club knows me personally, <a href='https://www.instagram.com/explorchestra/?hl=en' target='_blank'>they still use the banner</a>.

				"description": "This sweater was born out of a conundrum. I had inherited several skeins of orange-ish brown-ish yarn from my Grandma Fran's stash. It was a sweater quantity of yarn, but it wasn't a color that I would normally wear. But it did look good with jeans! So, I decided that it would make a good backdrop for a colorwork sweater - and Birkin, by Caitlyn Hunter, seemed like the right pattern to honor my Grandma Fran and bring out the beauty of the color of the yarn. In the context of leaves and flowers, the yarn no longer reminded me of rust, but of honey and autumn leaves and the light of a low sun at golden hour... Eventually, with help from my dad, I found the perfect pairing of colors for the flower and leaf motifs. I added some subtle waist shaping, but I also kept the sweater fairly cropped - a new kind of fit for me - and it turned out to be very flattering!"

				"description": "This cat was born out of the fear that I'd miss my cat, Mae, when I was in college, and also a desire to try to move toward making a knitted cat design, the way I'd recently made a bunny. For this, I used elements of the <a href='https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/bunny-from-a-square' target='_blank'>bunny from a square pattern</a> and also the <a href='https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/sources/best-in-show-knit-your-own-cat' target='_blank'>Best in Show: Knit Your Own Cat</a> book (given to me by my cousin Laura). I started with the legs, and modified the Best in Show pattern to be a stuffed animal-sized cat (rather than a tchotchke) and to have more or less the same markings as Mae (including her 'lucky foot'). Then I cobbled together the rest of it, taking techniques from the 'bunny from a square' pattern! By the time I got to the back, I used more solid black - hence why this cat looks related to Mae, but not quite her."
