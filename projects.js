For the second (with Pedro the bunny), I decided to play into the silliness of a knitted rabbit 'eating' a crocheted carrot by showing the yarn unraveling all along, ending in a big pile of yarn and an official announcement."

				"description": "When my dad went to Norway, he brought me back some souvenir yarn - real, non-superwash wool. I had been toying with the idea of making myself a pair of boot-style slippers. I'd only tried felting one other time, when my grandma helped me felt my 20s hat, and I wanted to give that another try. I also knew by that point that I really liked colorwork. I decided to use a basic felted slipper pattern, but put my own twist on it by pulling elements from various colorworking charts to make a whole scene. It's a hope for the future, encoded in the form of knitting. Two cats by the window, a dog outside, playing in the snow, and bunnies safe and cozy in their warrens. A steaming cup of tea warms my toes."

I now wear it basically every Halloween, and I've gotten many requests for commission. But... no. It was a very fiddly project! I'm glad I did it, but never again."

				"description": "This cat was born out of the fear that I'd miss my cat, Mae, when I was in college, and also a desire to try to move toward making a knitted cat design, the way I'd recently made a bunny. For this, I used elements of the <a href='https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/bunny-from-a-square' target='_blank'>bunny from a square pattern</a> and also the <a href='https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/sources/best-in-show-knit-your-own-cat' target='_blank'>Best in Show: Knit Your Own Cat</a> book (given to me by my cousin Laura). I started with the legs, and modified the Best in Show pattern to be a stuffed animal-sized cat (rather than a tchotchke) and to have more or less the same markings as Mae (including her 'lucky foot'). Then I cobbled together the rest of it, taking techniques from the 'bunny from a square' pattern! By the time I got to the back, I used more solid black - hence why this cat looks related to Mae, but not quite her."

I modified this pattern, adding short rows and increases and decreases until - to my surprise - I'd come up with my own, substantially different, design.

I 'weighted' the letters differently by simply adding more of certain letters to the array so that there would be a great chance of those ones being picked."
